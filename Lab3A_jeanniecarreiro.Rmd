Challenge questions (set 1)
The class of the object surveys is a data.frame
34,786 rows by 13 columns
There are 48 species

# indexing and subsetting data frames to extract specific data you need to specify rows and columns

# here are the different ways to do that that end up with the same result

```{r}
# first element first column, vector
surveys[1, 1]
# first element 6th column, vector
surveys[1, 6]
# first column, vector
surveys[,1]
# first column, data.frame
surveys[1]
# first 3 elements in 7th column, vector
surveys[1:3, 7] 
# 3rd row, data.frame
surveys[3, ]
# same as head(surveys)
head_surveys <- surveys[1:6 ] 
```

# : is a function that created numeric vectors of integers in increasing order 

```{r}
10:1
```

# exclude indices of a data frame using -

```{r}
# except the first column
surveys[, -1]
# same as head(surveys)
surveys[-(7:34786), ]
# subset data frames by calling column names (below)
# data.frame (1)
surveys["species_id"] 
# vectors (3)
surveys[, "species_id"]
surveys[["species_id"]]
surveys$species_id
```

Challenge questions (set 2)
Create a data.frame (surveys_200) containing only the data in row 200 of the surveys dataset.

Notice how nrow() gave you the number of rows in a data.frame?

Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.
Compare that with what you see as the last row using tail() to make sure itâ€™s meeting expectations.
Pull out that last row using nrow() instead of the row number.
Create a new data frame (surveys_last) from that last row.
Use nrow() to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named surveys_middle.

Combine nrow() with the - notation above to reproduce the behavior of head(surveys), keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.

```{r}
# Challenge questions set 2
surveys200 <- surveys[200, ]
nrows <- nrow(surveys)
surveyslast <- surveys[nrows, ]
surveysmiddle <- surveys[nrows/2, ]
surveyshead <- surveys[-(7:nrows), ]
```
